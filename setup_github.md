# 🚀 GitHub Setup Guide for PlayBook Pro

## Quick GitHub Deployment

### 1. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "🏆 Initial commit: PlayBook Pro - Championship Website Design Generator"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it: `playbook-pro` or `website-design-generator`
3. Add description: "🏆 Sports-themed website design prompt generator for professional athletes"
4. Keep it public (or private if preferred)
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### 3. Connect and Push
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/playbook-pro.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Optional: Set up GitHub Pages

3. Create `.github/workflows/streamlit.yml` for deployment
